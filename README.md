# Week 1 Project

## The Music Bar Project

### **Do note that this is currently a prototype!!**

### Important Info

This is currently part of my one month challenge to build up my cv.
I'm Currently bulding one project a week, and this is week 1's project.
In which I use barebones HTML, CSS and JS (Javascript) to build a simplistic website.

I do plan on revisiting this project once the month is over to overhaul some stuff, fix some stuff and add some new stuff.

### Function

Using the basic building blocks of HTML and Javascript I take in a audio file as an input.
Which is then reproduced inside the page, this while an animtion resembaling volume bars plays above the controls.

### Some need to know stuff to run properly

- It can only play one file at a time.
- You must pause the reproduction before changing file.
- Some of the view may be broken depending on aspect ratio.

### Future plans

Following up are some planned stuff for the near and far future do keep in mind that this isn't assured, just thought of during early development.

1. Song quee
2. Song progress Bar
3. Better UI
4. Better animations

### Thanks && other stuff
