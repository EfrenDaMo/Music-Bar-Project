# Week 1 Project

## The Music Bar Project

### **Do note that this is currently a prototype!!**

### Important Info

This is currently part of my one month challenge to build up my CV.
I'm Currently building one project a week, and this is week 1's project.
In which I use barebones HTML, CSS and JS (Javascript) to build a simplistic website.

I do plan on revisiting this project once the month is over to overhaul some stuff, fix some stuff and add some new stuff.

### Function

Using the basic building blocks of HTML and JavaScript, I take in an audio file as an input.
Which is then reproduced inside the page, while an animation resembling volume bars plays above the controls.

### Some need to know stuff to run properly

- It can only play one file at a time.
- You must pause the reproduction before changing files.
- Some of the views may be broken, depending on the aspect ratio.

### Future plans

Following up are some planned stuff for the near and far future do keep in mind that this isn't assured, just thought of during early development.

1. Song queue
2. Song progress Bar
3. Better UI
4. Better animations

### Thanks && other stuff

If you have any recommendations or ideas that should be implemented for the project, feel free to tell me.

The rights to the songs do not belong to me and are some songs are meant for testing. If they cause any trouble please feel free to contact me about it.

Thanks to the little dude who got me onto this project. Thanks to anyone who uses it, and thanks to you who read this.
